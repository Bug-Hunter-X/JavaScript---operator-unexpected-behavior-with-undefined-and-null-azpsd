# JavaScript + operator unexpected behavior with undefined and null

This code demonstrates the unexpected behavior of the + operator in JavaScript when dealing with undefined and null values.

The `+` operator behaves differently depending on whether the undefined or null value is the first or second operand.

- When the first operand is undefined or null, the result is NaN.
- When the second operand is undefined or null, the result is the first operand + 0.

This can lead to unexpected results when working with functions that may receive undefined or null parameters.

The solution demonstrates how to handle undefined and null values in order to avoid unexpected results.
